  <p>This is a very easy, but elegant, baked chicken breast recipe that looks like you've spent hours in the kitchen when you've barely lifted a finger!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
    <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in a large baking dish.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
